# Pokemon-Battle-Theme

This App will give the USER a Pokemon Team based on the values that the user inputs on our quiz. These questions will let our JavaScript know which sorted pokemon array to access and push to the results screen. This App also has a loading screen that uses the GIPHY api that will generate a GIF based on the first pokemon selected for their team. The second API we used is the pokemon API which has the data for all pokemon up to and possibly including the last ~100 pokemon from the newest game. 

In our app we are using the first 151 pokemon in the MVP in order to ensure that our code is working fine and that we will be able to demostrate the functionality that the code can provide. Pokemon are sorted into 4 different categories using their abilities indentifying feature, these include sorted arrays are based off the features of: Tough, Flexibile, Warm and Cold.
